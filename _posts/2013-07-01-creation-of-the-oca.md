Dear community,

We're working for years hands in hands on OpenERP now, and lots of great work has been achieved since then. Eight months ago, we were pushing the community further by suggesting a new organization on Launchpad (the development platform) to better work together. This was related on this post here: <a href="https://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/new-community-organization-for-openerp/">https://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/new-community-organization-for-openerp/</a>

This allowed us to put in place lots of good practices used in other big Open-source projects like: code and peer reviews, team of people and projects organized by topic and a real structure to manage and promote the meritocracy between us all. From there, other great contributors joined us and start working together. <a href="https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer">The community reviewer team</a> is today composed by 11 other partners where the most actives and invested are : <a href="http://camptocamp.com">Camptocamp</a>, <a href="http://therp.nl/">Therp</a>, <a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/">Savoir Faire Linux</a>, <a href="http://vauxoo.com/">Vauxoo</a>, <a href="http://www.akretion.com/">Akretion</a>.

**Today, the time has come to go even further. Initiate by <a href="http://camptocamp.com">Camptocamp</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://therp.nl/">Therp</a>, <a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/">Savoir Faire Linux</a>, <a href="http://vauxoo.com/">Vauxoo</a> and <a href="http://www.akretion.com/">Akretion</a>, we are proud to announce the creation of the worldwide "<a href="http://openerp-community-association.org/">OpenERP Community Association</a>".**

Camptocamp want to thanks other founding members for their supports in this initiative.
