## Organization

OCA's Projects are all the devs that has been produced and maintain by the community around [OpenERP](https://www.openerp.com/).

We are in the process of bringing all devs together, today the current community organization on the [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) plateform is the most representative work achieved.

We are organized in [community team by topic](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer/+participation) and each of them handle various projects. The team is responsible to review and commit the work of the community in the related branches of their related projects. Anyone can contribute to any projects by submiting bug reports, merge proposal, patches,..

A [community reviewer team](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer) has been setup to be part of all community teams and help them in the review process. This team is composed by OpenERP Developers and Experts that have a very good knowledge on OpenERP. They are elected here based on Meritocracy.
